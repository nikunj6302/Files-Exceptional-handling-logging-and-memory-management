What is the diffence between interpreted and compiled languanges?\n"," - Interpreted languages, like Python or JavaScript, are executed line by line by an interpreter, which translates and runs each instruction as it goes. Compiled languages, like C++ or Java, are first translated entirely into machine code by a compiler before being executed.\n","\n","2. What is exceptional handling in Pyhton?\n"," - If there is an error in a code we can hanle that error with exceptional handling like we can get the type of error as output and the code will run after the error as it is.\n","\n","\n","3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n"," - In the exceptional hanlng the final block will run always like regard less the error the code under the final block will always exceuted.\n","\n","4. What is logging in Python?\n"," - To get exect location of the error we can log the whole code in a directory and we will find out where is the error accur so we can work on it.\n","\n","5. What is the signigicance of the __del__ method in Python?\n"," - the __del__ method is used to delete any functions or vatiable from the code.\n","\n","6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n"," - This statement imports the entire module. To access items within the module, you need to use the module name as a prefix. And in from ...  import we can just import only the item we need from the module, insteed of importing whole module.\n","\n","7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n"," - We can handle the multiple exceptions by try and exept specific errors like ValueError,ZeroDivisionError one by one.\n","\n","8. what is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n"," - We can operate any methon as a variable like in code we can write with ..... as x . so the whole oparation will store as x.\n","\n","9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n"," - Multithreading will run the code concurrently on multithread in a single processor, while in multiprocesseor run the code paraller in multiple processor.\n","\n","10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n"," - We can logg and note down everything regarding the code that we are working on and we if there is an error we can find it and manage it by looking in the logg we made.\n","  \n","11. What is memory management in Python?  \n"," - Python memory management is the process of allocating and dealing with memory so that your programs can run efficiently.\n","\n","12. What is the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n"," - basic steps are use try adn then write the code and if the error will occur do except type of error as e and print the error as e.\n","\n","13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n"," - Memory management is crucial in Python for ensuring efficient resource utilization and preventing issues like memory leaks.\n","\n","14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n"," - try is for try the code if it is okay run it and if it through an error then exept will say print the type of error so we can solve it.\n","\n","15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n"," - Python uses a hybrid garbage collection system consisting of reference counting and generational garbage collection. This system automatically manages memory, freeing up space occupied by objects that are no longer in use\n","\n","16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n"," - Else block in exeptional handling says that if the code in try will through an error then only run the else code.\n","\n","17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n"," - The common logging levels are Info, Watning, Error, Debug, Critical, Shutdown.\n","\n","18. What is difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n"," - The os.fork() system call and the multiprocessing module in Python both enable the creation of new processes, but they differ significantly in their approach, portability, and use cases\n","\n","19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n"," - if we open a file in a writing mode, what we have write does not save in file untill we do not close the file.\n","\n","20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n"," - file.read is for read the whole file while the file.readline is use for read any specific line.\n","\n","21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\n"," - for logging we use import logging.\n","\n","22. What is the os module in Python used for in the file handling?\n"," - for file handling we use import os and import sys modules.\n","\n","23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n"," - Challenges associated with memory management in Python include:Memory Leaks, Memory Bloat, Garbage Collection Overhead, Fragmentation, Limited Control, Multithreading and Multiprocessing, Reference Counting Overhead:\n","\n","24. How do you raise a exception manually in Python?\n"," - to raise a exeption maually we need to define an constum class of an error which is child class on Exception and just give the condition where need to raise the error.\n","\n","25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n"," - to run the code more effectivly and faster we can use multithreading."],"metadata":{"id":"PwVKGopYMCF7"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#Practical Assingment"],"metadata":{"id":"-w0pTbAPTuuX"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Ans. 1\n","with
